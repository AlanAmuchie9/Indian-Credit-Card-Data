# Indian-Credit-Card-Data
An analysis of the credit card usage in india using SQL  
## Introduction
A marketing company in Europe hired me and presented me with a dataset cojntaining the credit card usage in different cities of India. I was tasked with using SQL to query the data and identify interesting patterns and trends that will be useful in helping the company achieve it's marketing goals.

### Problem Statement

The first step is to define the problem. The questions I and the company are trying to answer are:
1.	Total spent per city
2.	How does spending vary by card type?
3.	What are the trends in spending amount over the years
4.	What is the relationship between amount spent and gender
5.	Is there a relationship between the amount spent and the season
6.	What is the frequency of use in the top 3 cities
