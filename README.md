# Indian-Credit-Card-Data
An analysis of the credit card usage in india using SQL  
## Introduction
A marketing company in Europe hired me and presented me with a dataset cojntaining the credit card usage in different cities of India. I was tasked with using SQL to query the data and identify interesting patterns and trends that will be useful in helping the company achieve it's marketing goals.

### Problem Statement

The first step is to define the problem. The questions I and the company are trying to answer are:
1.	Total spent per city
2.	How does spending vary by card type?
3.	What are the trends in spending amount over the years
4.	What is the relationship between amount spent and gender
5.	Is there a relationship between the amount spent and the season
6.	What is the frequency of use in the top 3 cities
7.	What are the cities with the top 10 spendings
8.	How much does each gender spend on different expense types
9.	What is the average amount spent on each card type
10.	What is the average amount spent by each gender
11.	How much was spent in particular cities with the corresponding year

### Data Sourcing
In this project, the dataset used is gotten from Kaggle. It has only one table that contains 26,052 rows and 8 columns

### Data Importation
The dataset was downloaded in CSV format and was analysed using Microsoft SQL Server. After importation, the data needs to be be processed and cleaned to get accurate results because using messy, dirty data leads to inaccurate insights.

### Data Transformation and Cleaning
This is one of the most important steps in data analysis. The dataset was checked for duplicates and null values.
