# Indian-Credit-Card-Data
An analysis of the credit card usage in india using SQL  
## Introduction
This data analysis project helps to give insight into the use of credit cards in various Indian cities. By analysing this data set, we hope to identify trends, make sale and profit driven recommendation

### Problem Statement
The first step is to define the problem. The questions I and the company are trying to answer are:
1.	How does spending vary by card type?
2.	What are the trends in spending amount over the years
3.	What is the average amount spent by each gender
4.	What are the cities with the top 10 spendings
5.	How much does each gender spend on different expense types
6.	How much was spent in particular cities with the corresponding year

### Data Sourcing
In this project, the dataset used is gotten from Kaggle. It has only one table that contains 26,052 rows and 8 columns

### Tools
 - Excel
 - Microsoft SQL Server

### Data Importation
The dataset was downloaded in CSV format and was analysed using Microsoft SQL Server. After importation, the data needs to be be processed and cleaned to get accurate results because using messy, dirty data leads to inaccurate insights.

### Data Transformation and Cleaning
The data was cleaned in Microsoft Excel by checking for duplicates, blank rows, wrong spellings, outliers

### Data Analysis
The first question this analysis aims to solve is 'How does spending vary by card type'. The amount spent by card type can be an indication of the popularity of the card type. Further research into the company can give us insight on what makes it popular or not so popular as the case may be. It was discovered that the silver card has the most amount spent on it, and on further inspection, it was discovered that it has more users. therefore, more users leads to more money spent with it.

The SUM in the query can be replaced with AVG to find the average spending per card type

The second question, 'What are the trends in spending over the years' aims to understand the changes in spending habits of users. This can be as a result of economic factors like inflation or economic growth. The highest amount was spent in 2014, then 2015 and the least was spent in 2013. Research could be carried out to get a picture of the economic situation of India in each particular year

A new column for the years didn't have to be added, but I added it for better understanding of the data set

The third question, 'What is the relationship between gender and amount spent' answers the question of which particular gender spends more. Knowledge of spending by gender could be used by companies to create targeted ads and promos to a specific gender.

The fourth question, 'What cities have the top 10 spendings' helps us understand the places where people tend to spend more electronically. These are the top 10 cities where eletronic spending via card is most popular. Cities like this tend to be more developed and have more infrastructure, so corporations can focus their resources here to grow their business

Knowing how much each gender spends on a particular expense can help companies tailor their marketing strategies and product offerings based on the spending habits of each gender. In this query, we made an inquiry into how much each gender spends on bills and it was discovered that females spent more

### Key Insights

### Recommendations
1.	Focus on High-Spending Cities:
 - Recommendation: Since some cities show significantly higher spending, targeted marketing campaigns and promotions can be directed towards these cities to maximize returns. Additionally, understanding why certain cities have higher expenditures can provide insights into customer behavior and preferences.
4.	Optimize Card Type Offers:
o	Recommendation: Analyze which card types are associated with the highest spending and tailor offers or rewards programs to encourage more usage of these card types. For instance, if Platinum cards see the highest spending, exclusive benefits can be provided to Platinum cardholders.
5.	Analyze Seasonal Trends:
o	Recommendation: By identifying months or periods with peak spending, businesses can prepare for increased demand, optimize inventory, and launch timely promotions. For instance, if the end of the year sees a surge in spending, special holiday discounts or campaigns can be planned accordingly.
6.	Gender-Based Marketing:
o	Recommendation: If there are significant differences in spending between genders, customized marketing strategies can be developed to cater to each groupâ€™s preferences and spending habits.
7.	Identify Outliers and Unusual Transactions:
o	Recommendation: Transactions significantly higher than average could indicate potential fraud or exceptional spending behavior. These should be flagged and investigated to ensure they are legitimate and to understand the circumstances that lead to such high expenditures.
8.	Enhance Customer Engagement in Lower-Spending Areas:
o	Recommendation: For cities or regions with lower spending, strategies can be developed to boost engagement and spending. This might include localized promotions, partnerships with local businesses, or community events to drive brand awareness and usage.
9.	Expense Type Insights:
o	Recommendation: If the majority of transactions fall under a specific expense type, consider diversifying offerings or highlighting benefits for underrepresented expense types to balance the spending distribution.
10.	Monitor and Adjust Yearly Budgets:
o	Recommendation: Based on yearly spending trends, budgets can be adjusted to reflect anticipated changes. If certain years show higher spending, it might be worth investigating the factors contributing to this increase and preparing for similar trends in the future.
11.	Rewards and Incentive Programs:
o	Recommendation: Implement or adjust rewards programs based on card type, year, and city spending data to encourage increased usage. For example, higher cashback rates or bonus points can be offered during months with traditionally lower spending.
12.	Understand and Target High-Value Customers:
o	Recommendation: Customers who consistently spend large amounts can be identified and targeted with exclusive offers, personalized services, and loyalty programs to maintain their engagement and encourage continued high spending.
13.	Transaction Count Insights:
o	Recommendation: Understanding which expense types or card types have the highest transaction counts can inform decisions on where to focus customer service efforts or technological improvements to enhance user experience.
14.	Comparative Analysis:
o	Recommendation: Conduct a comparative analysis between different years to identify any significant shifts in spending patterns. This can help in forecasting future trends and adjusting strategies accordingly.
By leveraging these recommendations, businesses can optimize their strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive growth and profitability based on data-driven insights.
