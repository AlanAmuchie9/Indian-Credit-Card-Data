## Introduction
This data analysis project helps to give insight into the use of credit cards in various Indian cities. By analysing various trends, we hope to identify trends, make sale and profit driven recommendation

### Problem Statement
The first step is to define the problem. The questions I and the company are trying to answer are:
1.	Total spent per city
2.	How does spending vary by card type?
3.	What are the trends in spending amount over the years
4.	What is the relationship between amount spent and gender
5.	Is there a relationship between the amount spent and the season
6.	What is the frequency of use in the top 3 cities
7.	What are the cities with the top 10 spendings
8.	How much does each gender spend on different expense types
9.	What is the average amount spent on each card type
10.	What is the average amount spent by each gender
11.	How much was spent in particular cities with the corresponding year

### Data Sourcing
In this project, the dataset used is gotten from Kaggle. It has only one table that contains 26,052 rows and 8 columns

### Tools
 - Excel
 - Microsoft SQL Server
